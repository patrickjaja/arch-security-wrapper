--- python-shiboken2 (aur) ---
Verdict: SAFE SAFE
Risk: NONE NONE

Based on the limited investigation, I can provide the following security assessment:

The package appears to be in an initial or incomplete state, with no indication of malicious content. The presence of standard log files and a git repository suggests this is a normal software development setup.
