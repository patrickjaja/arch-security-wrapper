Summary: Standard Arch Linux package for Redis desktop manager Standard Arch Linux package for Redis desktop manager
After a thorough review, here's my security analysis:

VERDICT: SAFE
RISK: NONE
SUMMARY: Standard Arch Linux package for Redis desktop manager

DETAILS:
- Source is official GitHub repository (https://github.com/tiny-craft/tiny-rdm)
- Uses standard build process for Electron/Go application
- No suspicious remote script downloading
- Conditional NPM registry change based on geolocation (CN) is standard practice
- Build script uses standard tools: wails, npm, nvm
- No obfuscated code or encoded payloads detected
- Uses standard Linux package installation methods

REMEDIATION:
- No remediation needed
- Package appears to be a legitimate Redis desktop manager

Notable observations:
- Conditional NPM mirror (line 53-59 in PKGBUILD) for CN users is a common optimization
- Uses curl to check geolocation, which is not a security threat
- Builds from source using official GitHub tag
- Uses standard build tools (wails, npm, nvm)

The package passes all security checks and appears to be a safe, standard Linux application package.
