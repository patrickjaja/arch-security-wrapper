RISK: LOW
SUMMARY: Redis desktop manager with standard build process

DETAILS:
1. Source is from official GitHub repository (https://github.com/tiny-craft/tiny-rdm)
2. Uses standard build tools (nvm, npm, go, wails)
3. Conditional npm registry change for CN-based users (line 53-59 in PKGBUILD)
   - Uses official npm mirrors (npmmirror.com)
   - Uses official go proxy (goproxy.cn)
4. Builds from source using Wails framework
5. Installs binary, desktop file, and icon to standard locations
6. GPL-3.0 licensed
7. No obfuscated code detected
8. No suspicious remote script downloads
9. No systemd service creation
10. No PATH or .bashrc modifications

The only minor observation is the IP-based registry selection, which is a common practice for developers in regions with restricted internet access.

REMEDIATION:
- None required
- Standard package build process
- Official source repository
- Transparent build steps

Recommendation: This package appears to be a legitimate, open-source Redis desktop manager with no apparent security risks.
